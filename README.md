# Connect 4 - Game
Connect 4 is a well known vertical game played with "checkers".

The board is placed in the stand to hold it vertically and the players drop checkers into one of the 7 slots, each of which holds 6 of the "checker's" men, until one player succeeds in getting 4 in a row--horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
